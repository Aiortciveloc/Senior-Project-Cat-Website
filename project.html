                Cats are the most wonderful house pet in the world and surprisingly one of the most loving friend you can have, and it is disappointing to think that a lot of people don't know much about them. <a target="_blank" href="http://i.imgur.com/oh0Ib.jpg">This picture</a> explains perfectly how people view cat breeds. People don't know much about different cat breeds and just view them as a cat. When you see a cat, you don't think Himalayan, Bengal, or Aegan. You think "that's a cat;" compare this to a dog, when you gaze at a dog, your first thought is the exact breed it is. This site is devoted to teaching about the different types of cat breeds and to inform all individuals around the world. There are 98 types of domestic cat breeds and all of them are loveable in their own unique way. I'm tired of society not being able to correctly name a cat breed and strive to change that starting now. You can view all of the 98 domesticated cat breeds here on this site and read about facts and special traits of each breed. You will also be able to view facts about cats in general and learn interesting traits about them you never knew before. You can view all of this in the menu in the upper left corner.
