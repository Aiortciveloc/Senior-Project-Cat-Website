        	   Donskoys come from Russia, after a kitten who was being tortured got saved by a pedestrian. She took the cat home and fed it back to a healthy state. This cat sadly lost all of its fur, and could never grow back its coat. When this cat had kittens, the kittens also had no coat, and started a whole new breed of cats, called Donskoy. Nobody was interested in these cats, but one scientist discovered a way to mutate the genes to give them back some of their coat, which they successfully did. They are still for the most part naked, but they grow their coat in the winter, and shed it during the summer. Their coat is similar to human skin, and is wrinkled in some places. They have almond shaped eyes, which can be a variety of colors. They look very similar to the famous Sphinx cats. Donskoys are generally very friendly and smart, which means they can learn tricks and be trained effeciently. Sometimes, though, they might fight with other cats, but most of the days, they are friendly. Donskoys do not like being left alone for long periods, and demand you give them tons of attention. If you give them enough love, they'll become extremely loyal to you similar to a dog. Donskoys are not reccommended if you are away from home for long periods of time, and can't give time to your pets.
