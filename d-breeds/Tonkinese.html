                Tonkinese are a domestic cat breed produced by crossbreeding between the Siamese and Burmese. Tonkinese are beautiful, medium-sized cats, surprising heavy and muscular. Their fur is short, soft, and silky; it's easy to care for and wonderful to pet! Tonkinese come in 12 color and pattern varieties. The four base colors are the color of the extremes (face, ears, and tail), which are called the "points." The coat patterns refer to the amount of contrast between the body color and the points. The four base colors are Platinum, Champagne, Natural, and Blue. The three coat patterns are Pointed - which has a high amount of contrast between the extremes and the body, and typically have blue eyes; Mink - which has medium contrast and aqua eyes; and Solid - which has a low contrast between the body and the extremities and green to yellow-green eyes. Examples of the color patterns are Platinum Mink, Champagne Point, and Blue Solid. The Tonkinese personality makes this breed popular as a companion cat. Loving, social, active, playful...yet content to be a lap cat. Tonkinese are firmly convinced that humans were put on Earth to love them. Intelligent and generous with their affection, a Tonkinese will supervise all activities with curiosity. The Tonkinese is a natural at inventing and playing games, using favorite toys to play fetch or delighting in games of tag and hide-and-seek with other pets - or even humans. Tonkinese kittens are great fun, but even the adults tend to remain playful throughout their lives. Scratching/climbing posts and a variety of toys are much appreciated by these funloving cats. A Tonkinese will quickly take over, running your home and your life! They quickly endear themselves to family and visitors, becoming your "door greeter" and entertaining guests. Tonkinese get along with children, other breeds of cats, and dogs. They prefer not to be ignored or left alone. Two Tonkinese will keep each other company and also lessen the amount of mischief that just one bored Tonk can get into. It's also very entertaining to watch two play together.
