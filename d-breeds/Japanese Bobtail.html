                 The first bobtailed cats arrived in Japan as gifts from the emperor of China to the emperor of Japan. They have been popular in Japan since than and have spread out to be popular in other parts of the world too. This breed's tell-tale characteristic, of course, is a short "bunny" tail that can be flexible or rigid, with one or more curves, angles or kinks, ideally extending out from the body no more than three inches. The fur fans out to create the look of a pom-pom on a shorthair, or a blooming chrysanthemum on a longhair. Each cat in the breed has a unique tail. The silky coat can be shorthaired or longhaired. In both lengths, the cats have little undercoat. Longhaired Bobtails may have a ruff around the neck, long fur on the belly, and fur that is noticeably longer on the tail and upper hind legs than it is on the upper part of the body. Japanese bobtail is very affectionate and great for a family setting. Due to their affectionate nature they make very good pets for children. They like to communicate with you with soft chirpy noises. This breed is highly attracted to water so you may find them running to get to running water or playing in their water dishes. They are very smart and enjoy being puzzled with rotating toys or chasing lasers or lures on fishing poles. They are very headstrong and don't like to change their minds on what they like or dislike. They are very busy and need a companion, preferable humans or other bobtails, however a dog will work to keep them entertained as well. This breed is known for their playful behaviour, they are always full of energy and mischief. This can be a down fall if someone is looking for a more relaxed cat that doesn't portray kitten like behaviours.
