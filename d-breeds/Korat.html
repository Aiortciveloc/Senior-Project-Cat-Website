                The Korat was discovered in Ampur Pimai of the Korat province in Thailand. The earliest known record of the Korat appears in The Cat-Book of Poems or Smud Khoi of Cats, produced some time during the Ayudhya Period of Siamese History (1350-1767). With his silver-tipped blue coat and huge green eyes-"as sparkling as the dewdrops on a lotus leaf"-the Korat is one of Thailand's most beautiful exports. He is noted as well for his heart-shaped head, large ears and alert expression. A Korat's eyes are blue at birth. As he matures, the eyes turn to amber, the pupil surrounded by a fringe of green. By the time the cat is two to four years old, the eyes have become the brilliant green for which the breed is known.The short single coat has hairs that are a light blue at the roots, then deepen, ending in a silver tip, producing a halo effect. Unlike some breeds, the coat has its silver-blue color from the time kittens are born, although kittens may have what are known as "ghost tabby" markings. These should disappear with maturity. The Korat's nose leather, lips and paw pads range from dark blue to lavender. They form strong bonds with their owners and respond warmly to cuddling, sitting as close as possible. They are very active in play but gentle with children.
