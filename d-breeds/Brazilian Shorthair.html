        		Brazilian Shorthair is the first cat to be recognized for originating from Brazil. This breed has an elegance about it that people just can't make out. It might be because their eyes are very expressive on how they feel. Their fur is short and does not shed much in all seasons, and the colors range to all sorts. Eye color resemebles the coat color to match. You can differentiate between male and female by looking at the heads; males have larger heads then females. Being outside or inside is fine with a Brazilian Shorthair, which makes them a perfect well rounded family cat. If you are thinking of adopting this furball, then don't take the time their a kitten for granted; that's when they are the most playful in their years, once they're grown up they will be a little bit more secluded and relaxed. This would be a great cat to make a part of the family, and the kids would adore this breed!
