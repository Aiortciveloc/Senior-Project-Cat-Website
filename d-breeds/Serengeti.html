                 The Serengeti is a breed of domestic cat, first developed by crossing a Bengal (domestic and wild hybrid) and an Oriental Shorthair. The ideal Serengeti cat is a medium sized cat with long legs. It should be in excellent physical condition, strong and muscular. It should appear as a graceful, statuesque, squarely built cat with a very upright posture. Also noticeable is the long neck that which blends into the base of the skull without tapering. Strikingly large, round tipped ears equal to length of the head are one of the main features of the Serengeti as are its bright, round eyes. They should have a gentle, confident, outgoing and alert temperament. The ideal Serengeti cat has an open, self-assured and friendly temperament. While they might be shy for a few moments in a new location, as soon as they warm up to their new owners and home they can become like Velcro, always wanting to be with you helping with every endeavor. These are extremely agile cats and very active. They love to get on high places and enjoy running through the house at full speed. They can be vocal, which comes probably from their oriental ancestors, and gladly talk with you about almost any subject. If properly introduced, they get along well with other pets.
