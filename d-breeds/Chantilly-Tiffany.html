        	   Chantilly-Tiffany is quite a mystery to most people. They originate from North America, and were thought to be extinct until 1967. Two of the cats were found in New York, United States and were bought extremely quick. They were then bred to repopulate the breed. Chantilly-Tiffany's have a unique look that almost reminds people of a lion with their long fur. Their coat is silky, soft, smooth, and has no undercoat. Their coat can be any of 5 colors including: chocolate, blue, cinnamon, lilac, and fawn. Also Chantilly-Tiffany's coat can be one of the four patterns: solid, mackerel, ticked, and spotted tabby. Eye color is tremendously bright whe ntheir young, and as they age, the eye grows more golden and intesifies. Loyalty is the trait Chantilly-Tiffany have the most of. They become very close to their owner if treated well and will smother you in love. If you have one of these amazing cats, and you work a ton, consider getting a companion pet for your cat, as this breed will get very lonely if left by itself for long periods of time, and needs someone to communicate with. With that being said, maybe consider a different breed if you find yourself working late all the time.
