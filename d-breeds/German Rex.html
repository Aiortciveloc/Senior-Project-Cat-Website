                The first two German Rex deliberately bred were two Rex kittens from a 1957 German House. The German Rex is a medium-sized breed with slender legs of a medium length. The head is round with well-developed cheeks and large, open ears. The eyes are of medium size in colours related to the coat colour. The coat is silky and short with a tendency to curl. The whiskers also curl, though less strongly than in the Cornish Rex. They may be nearly straight. All colours of coat, including white, are allowed. The body development is heavier than in the Cornish Rex - more like the European Shorthairs. The German Rex is a breed that becomes involved with her parent. She loves to be right next to her humans and must have some time with them every day. In general, she loves being handled by her parents.The German Rex is an athletic cat and will maintain her ideal weight if provided with enough space for exercise. Because the coat is close to the skin, you will easily be able to tell if your German Rex is getting too heavy. The German Rex is Amazing for people that are allergic to cat hair, as this cat doesn't have too much cat hair, and if you're looking for a fun family member.
