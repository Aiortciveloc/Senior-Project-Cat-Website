        		Burmese cats are similar to Birmans and siamese, but different in their own regards. Burmese originate from Burma, Thailand through tons of selective breeding to produce this particular breed after many failed attempts. Eventually though, they succeeded and started deporting them to countries all around the world. Their body is slender and sleek, with large, pointy ears. Their coats are short, sleek, and glossy, and can be a select amount of colors, but the color has to be uniform throughout the whole body, only shading darker on the head and underparts. This cat is noted as one of the most friendly breeds of cat, and is most similar to a dog in many aspects. This is because they develop a bond with their owners and get along with them when you first meet and spend time with them, causing a reliance on you instead of a tolerance; which is the case with most cats. They keep their playfulness all throughout their life and love to play games with their owner. Games can range from fetch to chasing a red laser pointer dot. Burmese are very vocal, but luckily have a sweeter voice that sounds relaxing to listen to. These cats make a great house pet, but be warned, if you do not have enough time to spend with them in a day, do not adopt this breed. This cat thrives on attention, and need it most of any other cat breed. The Burmese will be tremendously down if left alone for long periods of time.
