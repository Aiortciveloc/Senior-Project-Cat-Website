        	   The California Spangled originates from California, United States. This breed was developed to look similar to leopards. Their other wild cat counterparts, like Bengal and Ocicat took off more than these fellows, and were never bought much. Scientist wanted to make a domestic cat look-a-like for a leopard to make people realize how great leopards are, and help save them from going extinct. Their appearance is that of a leopard, with spots running all along their body. Their coat, though, can range from multiple colors including: bronze, gold, blue, brown, charcoal, red, black, silver, or white. Despite their similar looks to the throat-tearing leopard, they are much friendlier to humans than leopards. California Spangleds love to keep their owner company, are affectionate, and very curious. You'll find they are always getting in places they're not supposed to be, and pouncing on anything that moves to get the thrill of the hunt. If you want a companion that loves to play with you, and be full of life, then consider a California Spangled.
