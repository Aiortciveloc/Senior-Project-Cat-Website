        		The Bengal Cat breed is genetically bred to look similar to jungle cats, such as leopards, tigers, and ocelots. Bengal Cats have markings, which consist of stripes, spots, rosettes, and a white belly. Also, this breed typically has a black outline around their eyes. Luckily, though, Bengal cats are much friendlier then their jungle cats look alikes, and love being with humans. This feline breed loves to learn tricks and are very smart. You can teach them various request, such as jump, retrieve, or roll over. Much like their jungle counterparts, though, they possess many of the qualities leopards and other wild cats have. Bengals love to climb up everything in the house, and adore being in water. Bengals live to swim unlike other cat breeds, and can be often time found in ponds if you're not watching them carefully. Often times, Bengals are the dogs of the cat breeds. Your Bengal will love going on walks with you and fetch an object you throw. Be weary, though, Bengals love glittering objects, and snatch away unattended to jewelry without hesitation. Bengals are by far the most interesting and unique of the breeds, and highly reccommended as a house pet that will keep the family in delightful spirits.
