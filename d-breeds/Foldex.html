                Foldex is a type of cat developed in the Canadian province of Quebec by crossing an Exotic Shorthair and a Scottish Fold. Their coat can be long or shorthaired and be very smooth. Their coat comes in every color, pattern, and combination possible to a cat. The unique trait to the Foldex is their ears. The ears of the Foldex are small with rounded tips, and they have a single crease that causes them to fold forward and downward onto the head. The Foldex breed is known for being cheerful, curious, intelligent, and active. It is also an affectionate breed, willing to approach strangers with confidence and ease. These cats love being petted, and they have really charming personalities that are hard to ignore. These cats are fairly rare, being mainly found in Canada, with sometimes being seen in The United States and Europe. If you plan on getting one of these unique breeds, be ready to take some time need to find one you want.
