        		British shorthairs are one of the most ancient cat breeds in the world, dating back to first century AD. They were found in the area around and in Great Britain during ancient times. By the time World War One rolled around, this breed was falling out of favour and no one wanted to buy or breed them anymore. Breeders started mxing Persian blood into their genes to make them more pure, which brought a resurgence in the amount being bred, and introduced the British Longhair breed. Appearance is similar to the Longhair, except a short coat and a thinner tail. Their eyes and fur can range most colors and patterns, enless the coat is a british blue color, then their eyes will be a coppery orange. Their eyes are extremely round when set side by side with another breed of cat, which gives them an eerie feeling sometimes. Their coat is a fine texture because of their shorthair, and lack of an undercoat, which makes their fur feel plushy. Shorthairs are quiet and relaxing around the house, and don't like going outdoors much. They would do anything for you to stay at home and spoil them with love. If you can't give enough love to your pets, than a more solitary cat would be a more suitable match.
