                The Havana Brown cat was developed in the early 1950s by a group of English cat fanciers that began working together with an intent to create a self brown cat of Foreign Type. The ideal Havana Brown is best described as a cat of medium size and structure, firm and muscular, exhibiting a sense of power yet also elegance and gracefulness. The two most distinctive features of the breed are its color and head shape. Its distinctive muzzle shape, coat color, large forward-tilted ears and striking green eyes set it apart from other breeds. The color of the Havana is a rich, warm, even brown, tending toward red-brown rather than black-brown. The coat is short to medium in length, smooth, lustrous and close lying. The feel of the coat has been likened to that of a luxorious mink coat. Havana Browns become very attached to their family and do not thrive when left alone for long periods. They are curious and interactive and need to be a part of all that you do. It is common for the Havana Brown to become best companions with the family dog. Many owners also find it surprising how easily they can travel with their Havana Brown without the cats objection. The Havana Brown is great for all families.
