                The Sokoke is natural breed of domestic cat, developed and standardised, beginning in the late 1970s in eastern, coastal Kenya. It is characterized by a slim, muscular, and graceful body with higher rear legs and a long, pointed tail. It has a small head with medium-sized ears having slightly rounded tips and almond-shaped eyes with light green or amber hue. In spite of its wild appearance, this lovable and friendly cat is easy to manage. It is a family-oriented pet that likes to bond closely to the humans. It does not always crave for human attention or like to be cuddled in the lap but loves to follow its owner around the house showing its affection. Since it is sociable by nature, the Sokoke mingles with other cats as well as other household pets. As an energetic and playful breed, it hates being left alone for long. It keeps itself busy by playing in quick, intense bursts. Known to be very vocal and talkative, it can continue with its conversations for hours. It can at times be aggressive, and may use its claws or teeth if threatened.
