                The Ragamuffin is a breed of domestic cat. It is a variant of the Ragdoll cat and was established as a separate breed in 1994. RagaMuffins come in all coat colors and patterns, with or without white, with the pointed and pointed with white colors being registered by the CFA, but not shown. These are striking cats whether the color is solid, tabby and white, tortoiseshell, or mink. Its coat pattern and its symmetry are not considered important but all RagaMuffin breeders love the unique patterns and varieties that come naturally within the breed. Their coats are medium-long and fully furred – similar to the coat of a rabbit. RagaMuffins are low maintenance cats. Although their coats are thick and plush, surprisingly they do not readily mat or clump and are easy to care for. Their overall softness makes you want to continually pet them, and when you go, these cats love every minute of your attention and just keep purring. A RagaMuffin’s personality is one of extreme sweetness. While this is hard to describe, it is best understood when you are owned by one of these cats. Over time, you begin to understand their exceptional personality and how it differs from that of most other cats. RagaMuffins form a strong bond with their families and once your home has been blessed with one, you will be forever hooked on the breed. They are addictive and you may soon find that just one of these cuddly teddy bears is just not enough. They are quite likely to go limp in your arms, as the “rag” part of their name implies. As for their disposition, they tend to be calm and are likely to be found curled in your lap as you read a book or watch television. Yet, these are not lazy cats. Just pull out their toys and you will find them ready for action. Because they are very trusting animals they must be kept indoors only. There are far too many dangers for them beyond the front door.
