                The Suphalak cats were mentioned in pictorial and written descriptions for the first time in the 'Tamra Maew', which is supposed to have originated in the Ayutthaya Kingdom, which existed between 1351 and 1767 AD. When they are in the sun, their coat typically emits an almost reddish cast. Though in normal light, they look more towards the darker chocolate side. The color of their whiskers is also brown, and the nose leather is of rosy-brown color. The paw pads are light brown, having a pink tone, while their eyes are a bright yellow to golden in color. The Suphalak cats are an active, interactive and assertive breed of cats that cherish the company of people. Being said so, it is needless to explain how dearly they are fond of their owners and family members. Being affectionate themselves, they expect the same love that they give to you. So, all that they hate is being left alone or ignored. They are playful and zealous, and need a little bit of your time and attention, especially when it comes to an interactive play session. So it is a good decision to provide these active felines with cat toys, and a separate enclosure, dedicatedly meant for them to explore around during their moments of adventure. This breed is intelligent, and would understand immediately what you want to say or express. Their prompt intelligence and communicative abilities often take on more to the dog-side.
