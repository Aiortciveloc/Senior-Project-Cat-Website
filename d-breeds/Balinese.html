        		Despite its name, the Balinese breed originates from America, not Indonesia. They derive from the Siamese cats that were imported to America, and officially at first were named long-haired Siamese cats; but was later decided this name was too much of a hassle and were renamed to Balinese cats. The coat of this breed is medium length and normally soft and silky. The tail of Balinese cats is always longer then their normal hair length, which gives it a poofy look. Their eyes can be anywhere from blue to violet, and the intesity can change with how old they are. Balinese cats are always born pure white, and develop darker spots later in years on their face, paws and tail. The Balinese breed is very social and loves to take interest into matters happening around it. This leads to them being vocal and loud throughout the day which can get on the nerves of their owner. These cats would make very good pets for a family if you deal with the constant pestering.
