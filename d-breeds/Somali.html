                The first Somali cats appeared in the litters of Abyssinians as long-haired kittens. The Somali is a product of a recessive gene in Abyssinian cats, though how the gene was introduced into the Abyssinian gene pool is still a mystery. The Somali is a well-proportioned, medium-sized cat with firm muscular development. The medium-length, soft and silky coat requires little grooming. The coat is longer around the ruff, tummy, and britches - with that lovely, fluffy, full tail. The feet have tufts of hair between the toes. The large, almond-shaped eyes range in color from intense green to rich copper. The coat pattern is agouti (also called "ticked"), which has multiple bands of color on each hair. The Somali comes in four recognized colors in CFA: ruddy, red, blue, and fawn. The colors showing in the ticked fur of the back and tail harmonize with the solid, lighter color on the cat's undersides. The Somali is a breathtakingly beautiful cat, with a vibrantly colorful coat, full plume tail, and alert personality. The combination of ticked, dramatically colored fur, striking facial markings, large ears, dark hocks, and full bushy tail and britches gives the Somali a wild "little fox" look which immediately captivates. The Somali is a combination of beauty and personality; a very intelligent cat, its zest for life and love of play (many will fetch toys, open cupbaords, and play with water) blossom with human companionship. The Somali is the epitome of everything most people want in a companion animal - lively, alert, and actively engaged in everything that piques their curiosity - but when playtime is over, they will seek all the attention and affection their caretakers are willing to give.
