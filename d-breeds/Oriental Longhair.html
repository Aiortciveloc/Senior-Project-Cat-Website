                The Oriental Longhair is a breed of domestic cat. It is closely related to the Oriental Shorthair. Oriental Longhairs feature a long, tubular, Oriental-style body but with a longer silky coat. The range of possible coat colours includes everything from self-coloured (black, blue, chocolate, lilac, cinnamon, caramel, fawn, red, cream and apricot), tortoiseshell, smoke, shaded or tipped, tabby or white. The eyes are almond shaped. The preferred eye color for Oriental Longhairs is green; except for the whites, which may have green or blue eyes, or be odd-eyed (two different colored eyes). If an Oriental Longhair is bred to an Oriental shorthair or a Siamese, the kittens will all be short-haired. However, if these kittens are reintroduced into a breeding program as adults, approximately half of their kittens will have long coats. The oriental longhair is a really active cat that likes to play a lot. If the owner does not have the time to do so, it will find a toy to play on its own. This breed enjoys jumping and does it really well, without breaking any objects due to its agility and elegance. The oriental longhairs are extremely intelligent and are ideal companions for people who like their pets always around since they will follow their owners everywhere. They are very loyal and get along well with other cats especially if they are of the same breed; they even cuddle with each other. These cats remain playful through their adulthood. These cats are not adapted to a life of living with quiet people and they get along best with other cats, children and dogs.
