        		 The cat breed was developed in Australia. They created this breed by crossing Abyssinian and Burmese breeds. Its first name was the Spotted Mist, but recently changed the name to Australian Mist to encompass all the varieties of the cat. This is the only breed from Australia, but they are all around the world. The Australian Mist are medium-sized and have short-hair. Their eyes are very large compared to their head and have a wide look to them. The coat patterns have three traits to them: a brownish color, the actual pattern, and the look of wearing a misted veil. These cats rarely scratch, so there's no reason to have them declawed. Australian mist tend to be indoor cats, and rarely stray outside. They make for great pets for people who also stay inside for a large chunk of their day.
