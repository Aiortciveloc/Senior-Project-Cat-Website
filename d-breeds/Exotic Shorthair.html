                The Exotic originates from the United States and was bred to be exactly like the Persian cat except for the coat. The coat has a thick, dense, plush, short coat. The Exotic coat is unique to the breed and gives them a soft, rounded, teddy bear look. This also makers it fairly easy to brush their coat. Their coats can range from multiple colors and patterns.  Exotic have the famous flat faces of persians, and also have gleaming golden eyes. The Exotic is an ideal breed that produces a quiet, sweet, peaceful and loyal companion. They are easy going and not much seems to disturb them. In general, they are extremely affectionate. They quietly beg for your attention by just sitting in front of you with an irresistible look focused on your eyes. They will jump in your lap to curl up for a nap or push their wet nose right into your face. Some like to sit on your shoulder and hug you when you pet them. Exotic are an amazing pet for you and your family to just settle down with at any point in the day.
