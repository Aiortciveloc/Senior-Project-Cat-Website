                Although some experimental breeding took place during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, including Pat Turner's Seychellois breeding program, the modern-day Oriental Bicolour owes its origins to matings initiated in the USA by Lindajean Grillo. The Oriental Bicolour is a cat of Oriental type with a long, slender body and tapering whip-like tail. The triangular shape of the head is made of straight lines with a straight side profile and large, wide-set ears. The eyes are green, except in the colourpoint varieties which have blue eyes. The coat on the shorthaired variety is sleek, close-lying and glossy, while that of the longhair is fine and silky, lying flat to the body with no thick undercoat and forming a plume on the tail. The full range of colours seen in Siamese and Orientals is permitted, however a defining feature of breed is that they always have white spotting. In a cat of show quality this should extend to cover at least one third of the body and the distribution may be random and quirky like splashed paint. These cats can quickly adapt to their surroundings when taken to a new place. The lovable, social, and friendly Oriental Bicolors crave human attention and make a great companion for their owners. They love to snuggle up, often seen clinging to their owners, especially after a day out. Being responsive by nature, they are suitable for those intending to spend quality time interacting with their pets. They are tolerant of the unfledged behavior of kids and do well with other household pets, including dogs. Although they have a frisky, lively, and playful disposition, these Oriental cats do not always demand playful interaction.
