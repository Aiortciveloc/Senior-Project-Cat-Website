                The Raas cat is a breed of domestic cats that evolved in Madura in the Raas Island of Indonesia. The Raas cat is a breed of elegant felines that evolved in Indonesia. It has physical characteristics very similar to a jungle cat, or a leopard. These cats have a graceful look with a size larger than most of the other cat breeds in general. The face of the raas is a little squarish shape. They have dark green eyes with an oval shape that are not too wide. The shape of the skull is roundish, with the chin being slightly tapered, while the ears are erect, pointy and long. Compared to most of the other common breeds, the tail of these cats is conspicuously long with a slightly-bent edge. Raas are cats are energetic and playful, but are apparently afraid of humans, and sometimes find it difficult to adapt themselves. But once they get tamed, you will surely fall in love with them all over again, when they stare at you with their kind, mesmerizing eyes. But, unlike most other cats, these cats do not want to work just for the sake of pleasing their owners. So, irrespective of the fact that how much they are appreciated for their 'good jobs', it will not really motivate them. On the contrary, it is the responsibility of the owners to search for ways of motivating them. Training the raas would need some innovation and loads of patience, since they might show stubborn and grumpy attitude at times. These cats, with a primitive modality, are basically moody, and hence, it is almost impossible to affirm that the methods that worked earlier for these cats will also work now. Since the raas cats had initially been bred for the purpose of hunting vermin, it is now considered a domestic cat with a primitive streak after years of domestication. It would be wise for the owners to train this cat with all patience. It is also advisable not to apply the training methods of dogs on these felids, since it would not be very much successful.
