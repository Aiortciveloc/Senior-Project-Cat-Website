            The Khao Manee cat, also known as the Diamond Eye cat, holds the title of the most expensive cat breed. It is a rare breed of cat originating in Thailand, which has an ancient ancestry tracing back hundreds of years. The Khao Manee is a very handsome and elegant breed of Thai cats with a long history. These felines are muscular and athletic built, and have exclusively pure white coat and blue eyes. However, odd-eyed Khao Manees are also not uncommon, and are much in demand as pets. Odd-eyed specimens have their one eye either green, or amber/gold. This breed has a medium size body and an average bone structure. The head is wedge-shaped, while their ears are erect and slightly large. The cat is considered extremely lucky in Thailand. Being sociable and friendly, it is devoted to its owner and family members, and would curl up next to them to cuddle, or would just perch on their feet or shoulders. In fact, though they are not very demanding, but just love humans and their attention; so much so, that they would hang around your front door to greet your visitors. You would often find the curious Khao Manees moving around your house, tapping on objects, climbing on a high platform or your refrigerator, investigating things around.
