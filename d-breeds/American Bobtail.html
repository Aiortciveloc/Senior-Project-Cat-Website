        		The American Bobtail is one of the many breeds of bobtails. Bobtail is defined by having a short tail, which the American Bobtail includes in its features. The tail is about half the length of most other cats, hence the name bobtail. Identifying this feline is as simple as looking at it's coat and tail. Their coat is shaggy, and can be either long or short. The American Bobtail is surprisingly rectangular compared to other breeds of cats. Coat colors can come in all shades and hues, but the patterns that appear on the Bobtail always lean towards a wild look in order to blend into nature. Bobtails have been bred to represent wild cats, but in domestic form. When you are feeling down, you can expect this cat to come and cheer you up as soon as possible. Though, they also love to play games with you including fetch or hide and seek for hours. American Bobtails are very easy going, and get along with other humans and animals remarkably. Sadly, this breed is also known for beign able to escape cages or locked rooms quite easily, which can prove to be a hassle if you're traveling with your beloved pet. Regardless of this matter, Amerian Bobtails are an excellent choice for families of all types.
