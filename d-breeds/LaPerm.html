                The LaPerm emerged around the early 80's as a spontaneous mutation of cats bred for pest control. The breed founders were Linda and Richard Koehl from The Dalles, Oregon, whose cat Speedy gave birth to a curly-coated kitten, named Curly, from whom all LaPerms descend. The LaPerm can sport anything from a wavy coat to ringlettype curls that range from tight ringlets to long corkscrew curls. The tightest curls occur on the underside of the cat, on the throat area, and at the base of the ears. The longhair is generally blessed with a curly plumed tail and often exhibits a full, curly ruff. The coat is moderately soft in texture, yet each cat's coat is distinctly unique. The shorthair has more texture to the coat than does the longhaired variety. It does not have the ruff, has a "bottle-brush" type tail, and the coat generally stands away from the body, parting down the middle. The LaPerm comes in every recognized color and coat pattern. LaPerms are gentle and affectionate but also very active. Unlike many active breeds, the LaPerm is also quite content to be a lap cat. The LaPerm will often follow your lead; that is, if they are busy playing and you decide to sit and relax, simply pick up your LaPerm and sit down with it, and it will stay in your lap, devouring the attention you give it. LaPerms seek human contact and will purr as soon as they become aware of your presence. They are inquisitive by nature and always want to know what is going on around them. They will reach for your face with their paws and rub their faces against your head, neck, and face.
