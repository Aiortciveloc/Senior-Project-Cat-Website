        		The bombay breed was first breeded in the United States in Kentucky. The creator wanted to make a cat similar to the black panther, and after a couple of failed attempts finally managed it. As the creator wanted, the Bombay resembles a black panther and has a dark, sleek black coat and copper eyes. Their fur is short and has a medium body build, though feel heavier than they look. Bombays are very approachable and love to interact with people. They get a long with other cats, but like to make themselves known as the "top cat." They are very vocal and tend to meow more than your average cat breed. This can make them intolerable, so it's not reccommended to get one if you are annoyed easily. Bombays are also very smart and can learn tricks if you desire them to including fetch or being on a leash. They make an excellent house pet for your family if you desire some playfulness.
