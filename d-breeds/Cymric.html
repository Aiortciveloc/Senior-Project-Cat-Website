        	   The Cymric breed originates from Canada. They developed as distant relatives to the Manx breed, after a mutation appeared on a Manx kitten. The mutation made the Manx cat have unusually long hair, therefore another breed was created, though it isn't recognized in Europe as its own breed yet. Cymric's coat is elegantly long and padded around their body. It can be any of the colors and patterns that the Manx have. Their eyes are large and wide, and can vary in color copending on their coat color. Cymric is one of the few cat breeds that love to be in water. Have a river or lake near your house? Expect to find a Cymric cat cooling off and playing in the water! Cymric's love to play with toys and their owners, and get along with almost any animal. Including to this, they are very intelligent, which means Cymrics learn tricks and command effeciently. Watch out though, if you don't play enough with them, they'll smother you with kisses on your cheek, which can be rather unpleasant. Cymrics are amazing for families that can pay attention to it every now and then.
