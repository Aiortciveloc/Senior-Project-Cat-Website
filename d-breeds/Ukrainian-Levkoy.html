                 The Ukrainian Levkoy is recent man-made breed, originally developed by Elena Biriukova in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Levkoy is a breed of medium-sized cat with a well-proportioned body that may appear slender, and at the same time muscular. It is distinguished by its dog-like face, an angled head, and soft, hairless, and elastic skin, which sometimes become wrinkled. Its inward-folding ears, large almond-shaped eyes, and a long tail further enhance its strange and unique appearance. Despite its weird appearance, the Levkoy with its loving, playful, and pleasant personality makes a great feline companion for pet lovers. It exhibits initial reluctance and reclusive behavior when brought to a new environment, but apart from that, it is extremely sociable, enjoying the company of humans as well as other pets like pigs, rats, and dogs. It gets along well with children and does not mind playing with them. This pet displays affection for its owner by following him or her around the house, often enjoying a loving cuddle. As a vocal cat, it likes to meow and purr through the day but makes more noise at dinner time.
