        	   The Burmilla breeds originates from the United Kingdom accidently when two different breeds mated without anyone knowing it. The two produced a litter of adorable kittens that were eventually classified as their own breed, the Burmilla. Burmillas bodies are described as elegant and graceful. Their hair length can be either shorthair or semi-longhair, but never longhair. Touching a Burmilla coat has the feel of silk, and is incredibly soft. The coat of a Burmilla can be a wide variety of colors, and one of two different patterns. Burmillas are very friendly and adore being with their owners most times of the day. They have kitten-like characteristics all throughout their life and love to play with you. This leads to them getting along well with other animals, people, and children; which makes them a great house pet. This cat would be amazing for you if you have a family that can donate their love to this lost soul and make it feel apart of the family.
