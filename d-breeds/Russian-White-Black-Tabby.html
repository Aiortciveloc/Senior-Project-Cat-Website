                 The Russian White, Russian Black, and Russian Tabby are breeds of cat created in 1971, derived from the Russian Blue. The fur of the Russian Black, White and Tabby cats is silky and plush, and its clear tippings give it a very lustrous shine. They also have an undercoat which is very fine. However, a bit of grooming is necessary though. Russians are very affectionate cats, and don't tend to be destructive. They are also very intelligent, sensitive and quiet. They can even easily learn how to use the toilet, how to open doors, etc. They like to fetch toys, so they are somewhat very similar to dogs. But, just by being devoted and loyal as they know to be, they make great companions for the entire family.
