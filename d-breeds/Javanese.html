              The Javanese cat is not from Java nor Indonesia. Genetically they are long-haired Oriental. The term "Javanese cat" was coined by a Helen Smith of MerryMews Cattery circa 1950. It is unknown if she had ever traveled to Indonesia. The name is derived from the tradition of using the names of the countries and islands of south-east Asia for Oriental cat breeds. Except for color and coat length, the Siamese and the Javanese are indistinguishable, having a svelte but muscular body with long lines and a wedge-shaped head that is long and tapering from the narrow point of the nose outward to the tips of the ears, forming a triangle. The unusually large ears are wide at the base and pointed at the tip, giving them the same triangular shape as the head. Medium-size eyes are almond-shaped. The body is often described as tubular and is supported by long, slim legs, with the hind legs higher than the front legs. The Javanese walks on small, dainty, oval paws and swishes a long, thin tail that tapers to a fine point. The appearance of the body is softened by a medium-length coat that is fine and silky. It is longest on the plumed tail. A Javanese is perhaps not quite as loud as his relative the Siamese, but he is most definitely just as  opinionated. He will tell you exactly what he thinks, and he expects you to pay attention and act on his advice. You can also count on him to “tell all” to visitors, so be grateful that most people are not conversant in the Javanese language. Do not get a Javanese if living with a chatty busybody would drive you insane. On the other hand, if you enjoy having someone to talk to throughout the day, the Javanese can be your best friend.
