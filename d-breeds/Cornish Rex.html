        	   The Cornish Rex originates from England, after a mutation happened to one of the kittens in a particular litter. Scientist were baffled on why this one kitten was different from its litter mates, but they did some breeding on that cat to produce a whole new breed, the Cornish Rex. Features include long, bat-like ears, a curly coat, and large eyes. Cornish Rexs are famous for their curly coat, which is short, and feels like velvet, silk, or rabbit fur. This breed loves to be around people, and are very affectionate to their owners. They love playing games with you, like fetch. Cornish Rexs are always looking for a goodtime with their family members, and will do anything for just a little bit of play time everyday. They are the perfect addition to a family looking for a active play mate.
