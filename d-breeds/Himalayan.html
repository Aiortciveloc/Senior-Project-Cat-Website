                The Himalayan is a man-made breed developed by crossing Persians with Siamese to bring in the color points and blue eyes of the Siamese. In all respects but coat pattern, the Himalayan shares the Persian's sweet expression and soft round lines. It has a large, round head; large, round eyes; a short nose; full cheeks; and small ears with rounded tips. The head is supported by a short, thick neck. A long, thick, shiny coat with a fine texture completes the Himalayan's look. It's long all over the body and includes an immense ruff around the neck, a deep frill between the front legs, long ear and toe tufts, and a full "brush," or tail. The coat color can be chocolate, seal, lilac, blue, red, cream tortie, blue-cream, chocolate-tortie, lilac-cream, seal lynx, blue lynx, red lynx, cream lynx, tortie lynx, blue-cream lynx, chocolate lynx, lilac lynx, chocolate-tortie lynx and lilac-cream lynx. For the most part the Himalayan is not a hyperactive cat. They like to play and they are active, but they like their lap time and prefer to be doing whatever you are doing! The best way to describe Himalayans is to say they are "people oriented." Himalayans will often attempt to "help" you do whatever it is that you are doing. They are in the middle of all of your activities, and they express themselves with a wonderful melodious voice. All they ask of us is our complete devotion.
