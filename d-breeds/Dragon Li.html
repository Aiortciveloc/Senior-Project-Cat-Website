        	   The Dragon Li is a breed that is very new and comes from China. They popped out of nowhere and no one knows where they came from. There is a lot of theories circulating around about where they originated from, but people mostly agree they are a descendent from a wild cat in China. The Dragon Li is a Chinese cat that exhibits a unique golden brown to a broken mackerel tabby pattern. Their coat can be a wide range of colors, or sometimes multiple colors. Dragon Li's eyes are always yellow or green, and shine brightly. Dragon lis are playful and have tons of energy to jump and run on you, for what seems like a neverending period. Another interesting fact is that this breed is very social and would get along with other animals or random cats. The one exception is younger kids, who they do not get along well with. The Dragon Li cats are not demanding or too much affectionate, and would hardly spend time coiling and sleeping lazy on the bed.They are devoted and loyal and would spend time sitting beside you, but not on top of you. They are appraised for their unmistakable intelligence. It is because of this trait that this breed will be benefitted from a variety of scratching posts, cat trees, interactive toys, and companionship. This breed would be best for a family that already has kids set in stone, or does not plan on having any for a bit.
