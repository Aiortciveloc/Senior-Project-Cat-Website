        	   The Cyprus cat is an ancient breed of cat that originates from Egypt. Egyptians brought this breed over to Cyprus in order to catch vermins such as snakes or rats. This is where they got there name from, due ti the vast amounts of them in Cyprus. Sadly, a major chunk of the population have turned feral in cyprus, but they still make an excellent house guest if domesticated. The cats build comes off as slightly smaller than your average house cat, and has a sleek frame. But don't let their small size fool you, they are very athletic and can climb efficiently. Their coat colors and patterns vary heavily because a major part of their population is feral, so differentiates these traits. Their eyes have been noted to be oblique, and to have a triangular face. If you can domesticate a Cyprus, they turn into a wonderful family member. They are highly adaptable, so can easily manage a new house, or house guest like a dog. They love to play with any toys you get them, or just lay down quietly in your lap while you stroke their back. Cyprus are great if you move around consistently, and want a traveling companion.
