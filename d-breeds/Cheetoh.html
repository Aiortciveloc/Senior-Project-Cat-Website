        	   Cheetohs are a relativly new breed of cat, being developed back in 2001 by breeding together a Bengal and Ocicat. These cats look exactly like their name suggests, and look like Cheetahs. They have spots running all around their body, and their coat is very smooth, shiny, and has a silky feel. This breed is one of the largest of all the breeds, averaging from 17-25 pounds, which is huge! Cheetohs get along very well with people and other animals, and love to spend time with their owners. They adore playing, pouncing on, and chasing toys. This cat also loves to lay down in your lap and fall asleep cuddling with you. The only downside to this breed is they demand a ton of love. If you cannot give at least a couple hours a day to spending time with this breed, then you are not reccommended for adopting this lively breed. Though if you can spend time with it, you will be loved fiercly, and the Cheetoh will be your best friend.
