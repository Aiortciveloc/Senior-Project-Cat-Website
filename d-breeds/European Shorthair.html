                The European Shorthair is a breed originating in Europe which refers to the common cats. The European Shorthair's coat is short, soft and glossy. The European Shorthair can be all natural colours, such as black, red, blue and cream, with or without tabby or white markings, and pure white. The eye colour corresponds to the coat colour and may be yellow, green or orange. Blue or odd-eyed individuals are possible if the coat colour is white. Because the breed has been developed from ordinary domestic cats, which have very different temperaments, the character of the European Shorthair is impossible to determine. Members of this breed may be very affectionate but there are others that prefer to be out mousing. Most European Shorthairs are strong and active, and as a rule they are friendly. They get on well with other cats and tolerate dogs well. European Shorthairs are intelligent and playful, and most of them are expert at keeping houses and gardens free of mice. This cat is a perfect addition to most average families of all types.
