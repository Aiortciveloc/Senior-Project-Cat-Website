        		 The asian cat was first breeded in Britain in 1981. Since then, this breed of cat has gotten tons of recognition throughout the world. Another popular name for the Asian cat is the Malayan cat. Asian cats are not that big, usually a medium build. Their eyes are round and are mainly yellow. They have short hair, and their coat is satiny and glossy. Most of the time, the asian breed has only one color on their coat, with some rare exceptions, but can range in many different colors. The asian cat is known to be very loveable and affectionate to its owners. Though, it can get itself into trouble a decent amount of times with its love to explore new places. They are very vocal and will meow at you as many times as it takes to get your attention when they need anything. If you get annoyed easily, or can't spend much time with your cat, then this is not the breed for you. If you meet that criteria though, then this cat will be amamzing for your family.
