                Cats with dark blue eyes were discovered in New Mexico among feral cat populations. The first cat, discovered in 1984, was a tortoiseshell named Cornflower. She was bred to males without the trait, which proved to be dominant, as all her kittens showed it. The breed was founded and named Ojos Azules, Spanish meaning 'Blue Eyes'. The coat is short, soft and silky and they are accepted except for solid white. The standard for the breed is still being developed however the deep blue eyes are a key feature that must be present. The coat itself should be soft and silky. There will often be white patches on the extremities such as the face, feet and tail. They are typically a medium-sized cat with a moderate triangular head shape with a pretty expression and large eyes that highlight the deep blue color. Due to their rarity, little is known about the temperament of these strikingly pretty cats. The handful that are known to exist are with breeders who are working with geneticists to determine if the gene is viable for conservation. If their efforts are successful, we will discover the underlying personality of the cats.
