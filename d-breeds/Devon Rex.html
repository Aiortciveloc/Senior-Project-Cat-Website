        	   The Devon Rex, or the Alien cat, was first discovered in the United Kingdom. Devon Rexs are similar to Cornish Rexs, but have a different mutation to produce their odd looking coat. Their coat is very curly, and unlike the Cornish Rex, lack guard hair, or the top layer of their fur that usually has pigment on it. Their fur makes this breed of cat one of the most hypoallergenic cats you can buy. Devon Rexs have large bat ears, and coat colors that can vary with age and time. Devon Rexs are incredibly loyal to their owners and love to snuggle down with you at night or in the middle of the day. They are astoundingly affectionate and will give you kisses everyday. There is no alone time for you when you own a Devon Rex; they will follow you around all day and night to spend time with you. They are also very playful, and would love to play and learn tricks with you to pass time during the day. Devon Rexs are social at heart, and communicate well with other animals and strangers.
