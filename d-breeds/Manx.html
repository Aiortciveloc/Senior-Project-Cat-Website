                The Manx cat is a breed of domestic cat originating on the Isle of Man, with a naturally occurring mutation that shortens the tail. Many Manx have a small stub of a tail, but Manx cats are best known as being entirely tailless; this is the most distinguishing characteristic of the breed. Although tail suppression is not the sole characteristic feature of the breed, the chief defining one of the Manx cat is its absence of a tail to having a tail of long length, or tail of any length between the two extremes. Manx cats exhibit two coat lengths. Short- or long-haired, all Manx have a thick, double-layered coat. Regardless of coat length, the colours and coat patterns occurring in the breed today run the gamut of virtually all breeds due to extensive cross-breeding. The most common coats are tabby, tortoiseshell, calico and solid colours. The Manx are very playful and intelligent cats who are devoted to their families. They have extremely powerful hindquarters which allow them to jump to great heights and run with rapid acceleration and quick turns. The Manx is often said to be "dog-like" both in their loyalty to their families and their love of interactive play. They have a great sense of humor and are not above playing practical jokes on their families. They get along wonderfully with children and other family pets and have been known to protect their families from real or supposed danger. If given the chance, they are still great hunters, and a house with a Manx will certainly never have to worry about rodents.
