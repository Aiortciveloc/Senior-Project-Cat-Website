                The Pixie-bob cat was bred in the spring of 1985. Originating in the Northwestern United States, the loyal Pixiebob is muscular, brawny cat bred to resemble the wild Coastal Red Bobcat found in the coastal mountains of the area. It is the only breed that accepts polydactyls (cats with extra toes) and comes in two coat lengths. These intelligent cats replicate the look of the wild bobcat but have the loving personality of the domestic cat. Often called dogs in disguise, the affectionate Pixiebob is devoted to its family and can be taught to walk on a leash to participate in family outings. These sturdy cats have the presence and stature of the bobcat with the personality of the domestic cat. The active, social Pixiebob is doglike in its loyal devotion to its family and makes a great companion for children while embracing the company of other pets. They bond strongly with their families and easily learn to fetch and to walk on a harness and leash. While the Pixiebob is an active cat wanting to take part in all your activities, it is also a very laid-back relaxed cat participating calmly in the family. They are an inquisitive, companionable cat that wants to be with you and to communicate with you in their own language of chirps, chitters and the occasional growl.
