        	  The Chartreux originates from France, with records of them dating back to the 1700's. These cats were free-roaming cats, or cats not domesticated. However, they were taken off the streets right before World War One, and because of that, the breed was saved. After World War one, most of the free-roaming cats could not be found as they were either dead, or moved to a secluded habitat. They were bred and shipped to the Americas soon after, where they are now very common. Even in france, their home country, people do not know too much of the Chartreux. Charteux's coat is fantastic since it is short, water resistant, and very beautiful. Their fur color is any shade of blue-grey throughout their whole body, with tabby markings or rings around their tail. Chartreux have deep, lovely orange eyes that look magnificent in the dark. The Chartreux are known to be very quiet, playful, and lazy. They like to play a bit, but prefer sleeping, or watching commotion from any leverage. Chartreux would love to lay down on your lap all day while you pet them behind their ears if that was possible. Additionally, they never meow, rather they use actions to express how they feel. Therefore, make sure you pay close attention to this breed to not miss anything that's wrong with him. This cat is a great addition to the family, as they play wonderfully with kids, and don't need too much attention to keep them happy if you happen to work the whole day.
