        		The Abyssinian cat is a short-haired cat with a "ticked" tabby pelt, where the hairs are different colors. Their fur colors start out dark when they are born, and slowly change to lighter shades as they mature. Their ears are slightly oversized compared to their body, and often times, Abyssinian cats get mistaken for wild cats. Abyssinian are very playful, love to move around and to climb. Abyssinians are often regarded as one of the smarter breeds of cats, and can be trained well too. Also, Abyssinians love being with their human and receive love. Though, they are still shy of unfamiliar humans and cats, and tend to hide in the presence of one. This cat got its name from the ancient empire of Abyssinia, which is now called Ethiopia. In todays society, Abyssinian cats are one of the most popular short-haired cats in the United States.
