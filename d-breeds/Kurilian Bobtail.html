                This new breed is not well known outside of its native territories. Though it is a native to Japan with a long history on a chain of islands, known as the Kurils, that runs from the easternmost point of Russia to the tip of Japan's Hokkaido Island. The Kurilian Bobtail is a strong cat with a wild appearance, medium to large in size, brawny with strong substantial boning, but despite the Kurilian Bobtails looks they are very gentle. They have excellent health and a very well balanced character with a trusting and outgoing personality. They adore their people and love to be caressed. They are very active and seek the highest point in the house to survey all that may be going on around them. The Kurilian Bobtail can be short haired or semi-long haired. The character of the Kurilian Bobtail is independent, highly intelligent, clever, inquisitive, sociable, playful, trainable, absent of aggression and very gentle. They are devoted to their humans and when allowed are either on the lap of or sleeping in bed with their owners. They adapt well to other cats, children, dogs and other household pets. They are excellent jumpers and are inclined to survey their domain from the highest point available to them. Highly intelligent they need to be shown or told only once what they are allowed or what is forbidden, but it is up to the individual cat to carry out their own will according to their mood.
