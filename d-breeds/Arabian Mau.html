        		The Arabian Mau is a unique breed as they originate from the Arabian peninsula. They are characterized by their desert colored coats. Since they are a natural breed from the Arabian peninsula, they have a coat that helps them blend in to their surroundings, which is desert. The Arabian Mau mainly have bright green eyes, but can have different colors. Also, ear length for this breed is substantially larger than other breeds. As for personality, this breed is splendid for the family, or anybody looking for a loving pet. Arabian maus are known for the absurd amount of love they give their owners. They are especially amazing for people who love silence, as this breed only ever makes noises when they are in need of something. Try and keep male Arabian Maus away from other male Arabian Maus, or there will be many fights over whos territory is whos. If you keep that in mind, this breed is especially neat to have for your family.
