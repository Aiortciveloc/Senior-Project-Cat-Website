                The first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, of Berkley, Michigan, who attempted to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. There are twelve colors approved by most registries, including The Cat Fanciers' Association, Inc. standard for the Ocicat breed. Tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, their dilutes, blue, lavender and fawn, and all of them with silver: black silver (ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver. Ocicats have almond shaped eyes. They also have large, strong bodies, muscular legs with dark markings, and powerful, oval shaped paws. Their heads can be described as having a "wedge" shape that is longer than wide. Their ears are tilted at a 45 degree angle. One of the most striking things about these cats is the dark contrasting spots. The body shape of the Ocicat is partway between the svelte Oriental and the sturdy American Shorthair. The breed's large, well-muscled body gives an impression of power and strength, and is greater in weight than expected by appearance. Ocicats are friendly and sociable and are not often shy around strangers. This makes them good family pets, and most can also get along well with animals of other species. Their temperament is similar to that of a dog and are often referred to as a "dog in a cat's body". Most can be trained to fetch, walk on a leash and harness, come when called, speak, sit, lie down on command and other dog-related tricks. Some even take readily to water. Most are especially good at feline agility because they are very toy-driven. These attributes make the ocicat a domestic cat that requires more attention from their owners.
