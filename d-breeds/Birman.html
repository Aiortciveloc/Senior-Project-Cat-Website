        		There is no clear answer as to where this breed originates from, but some experts say they are from Northern Burma. Though, the first traces of this breed are noted in France. The Birman were almost wiped out doing World War Two; only two were left alive after the war and had to be rebred back to substantial numbers with closely related breeds such as Persian and Siamese. The Birman's fur is medium-long and has a silky texture. Their coat can be easily matted if it's not taken care of regularly. They always have lighter color coats, with white paws that resemble gloves, and are the trademark of this breed. Their extremities (Face, tail, legs) are alwasy one of the colors chocolate, lilac, blue, seal, red, or cream. There are more colors in development right now though. These cats are regarded as friendly to family and strangers, and are excellent for a house pet.
