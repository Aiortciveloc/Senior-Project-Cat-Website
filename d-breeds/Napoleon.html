                The Minuet cat (also known as the Napoleon) is a recent breed. The breed was created by Joseph B. Smith, a Basset Hound breeder and American Kennel Club (AKC) judge. It is this amazing combination of that sweet expression face and the short legs coupled with an awesome personality that is the key to the enormous appeal to this relatively new breed - the Napoleon cat.  Big round eyes, virtually all colors ranging from shaded silver to solid whites to blue points to chocolate calicos to blue smokes and more, luxurious coats without being excessively cottony, medium sized bodies, and those legs - those cute short legs - what is not to love? Like the Persian cats, the minuets have a good nature, and a sweet, docile temperament. They are human-oriented, and with their love for their families and fondness to get petted and snuggled, they make perfect family pets. They are extremely intelligent, and can easily understand the needs of their family members, and can adapt themselves accordingly in the household. They are neither demanding, nor attention-seeking, and (hence) not very vocal. It will never disturb its master, if he is busy. The Napoleons are quite inquisitive, and would greet their family members at the door, and follow them around the house. They are cats devoid of aggressiveness, and hence, are complete safe for other pets and children. With all its loyalty, it will stay devoted to its master throughout its life.
